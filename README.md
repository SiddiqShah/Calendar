I explored one of Flutterâ€™s most powerful widgets â€” Transform Widget!

I used it while working on a calendar feature, and it really opened my eyes to how flexible Flutter can be. ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ The Transform Widget allows you to:

Rotate, scale, skew, or translate widgets

Create unique UI effects and animations

Enhance the user experience with custom designs

I went through its properties and learned how it works in detail, and Iâ€™m excited to apply this knowledge in more projects. ðŸ’¡
